class SimpleBinner(Binner):
    """
    Bins to a wavenumber grid given by ``wngrid``.
    The method places flux into the correct bins
    using histogramming methods. This is fast but can
    suffer as it assumes that there are no gaps in the
    wavenumber grid. This can cause weird results and
    may cause the flux to be higher in the boundary
    of points between two distinct regions
    (such as WFC3 + Spitzer)

    Parameters
    ----------

    wngrid: :obj:`array`
        Wavenumber grid

    wngrid_width: :obj:`array`, optional
        Must have same shape as ``wngrid``
        Full bin widths for each wavenumber grid point
        given in ``wngrid``. If not provided then
        this is automatically computed from ``wngrid``.

        Bins down spectrum.

        Parameters
        ----------
        wngrid : :obj:`array`
            The wavenumber grid of the spectrum to be binned down.

        spectrum: :obj:`array`
            The spectra we wish to bin-down. Must be same shape as
            ``wngrid``.

        grid_width: :obj:`array`, optional
            Wavenumber grid full-widths for the spectrum to be binned down.
            Must be same shape as ``wngrid``.
            Optional.

        error: :obj:`array`, optional
            Associated errors or noise of the spectrum. Must be same shape
            as ``wngrid``.Optional parameter.

        Returns
        -------
        binned_wngrid : :obj:`array`
            New wavenumber grid

        spectrum: :obj:`array`
            Binned spectrum.

        grid_width: :obj:`array`
            New grid-widths

        error: :obj:`array` or None
            Binned error if given else ``None``
